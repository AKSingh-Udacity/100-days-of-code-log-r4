**Project:** Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge: Mobile Web

**Progress:** from Lesson 3: Introducing the Service Worker

**Thoughts:** Learned what the **Service Worker** is:
- a JavaScript file that sits between you and network requests.
- a type of **Web Worker** meaning it runs separately from your page.
- a process that is invisible to the user and that can't access the DOM.

But, it does control pages by intercepting requests as the browser makes them.

## 2. The Benefits of Offline First
### Day 2: January,28 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge: Mobile Web

**Progress:** - Lesson 2: The Benefits of Offline First - Jake Archibald

**Thoughts:** The _Benefits of Offline First_ course was broken down into 13 segments. It discussed the use of **HTTP Cache** and laid out a new paradigm which loads content from cache first rather than relying on network connectivity to determine if content gets displayed.

This solves for all three of the following use case scenarios:
1. Great connectivity
1. Poor connectivity
1. Offline

_Offline First_ delivers the page (header and/or content) from cache FIRST, and THEN attempts to fetch content from the network.

Lastly, it introduces the **Service Worker**.

It's billed as a new browser feature and a total game changer- the greatest paradigm shift since asynchronous operations and one that allows **you to control the network rather than the network control you**.
