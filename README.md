## 32. Restaurant App - Stage 1 Offline Images
### Day 32: June 12, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![App showing offline image](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/24-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/24.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1* project from the Udacity Nanodegree course: [Web Accessibility](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891).

Today I focused on getting some final touches completed for this project. Between today and tomorrow I should have everything ready for submission.

Today included the following.

- I added a generic offline image to be used as a placeholder for images that aren't available to the app if it happens to go offline before the requested image is cached
- Added a favicon to the app
- Added accessibility labels to the filter controls (so that screen readers can pick these up)

## 31. Restaurant App - Stage 1 Cached Assets
### Day 31: June 11, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![App delivering cached assets](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/23-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/23.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1* project from the Udacity Nanodegree course: [Web Accessibility](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891).

This section of the code caches assets on service worker install and then serves these cached assets as requests are made.

```js
const staticCacheName = 'restaurant-static-001';

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(staticCacheName)
      .then(cache => {
        return cache.addAll([
          '/index.html',
          '/css/styles.css',
          '/js/dbhelper.js',
          '/js/register_sw.js',
          '/js/main.js',
          '/js/restaurant_info.js',
          '/data/restaurants.json',
          '/restaurant.html?id=1',
          '/restaurant.html?id=2',
          '/restaurant.html?id=3',
        ]).catch(error => {
          console.log('Caches open failed: ' + error);
        });
      })
  );
});
```

The cached assets were served if available otherwise a fetch operation is performed.

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    }).catch(error => {
      return new Response('Not connected to the internet', {
        status: 404,
        statusText: "Not connected to the internet"
      });
      console.log(error, 'no cache entry for:', event.request.url);
    })
  );
});
```

  navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js')
  .then(registration => {
    console.log(`Registration successful, scope is ${registration.scope}`);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.log(`Service worker registration failed, error: ${error}`);
  });
}
```

This was then included on each page.

## 18. The Picture Element
### Day 18: May 28, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![9-21](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-21.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-21.png)
[![9-18](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-18.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-18.png)

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 9: Full Responsiveness* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

This lesson covered the `<picture>` element and how it's used in **art direction**.

- **art direction** is the process of using different images for different viewport sizes

Here's an example of what the code looks like for the kitty above:

```html
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="kitten-large.png">
    <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="kitten-medium.png">
    <img src="kitten-small.png" alt="Cute kitten">
</picture>
```

The browser chooses the first matching media query.

This markup says:
- Use 'kitten-large.png' when the viewport is 650px or larger
- Otherwise, use 'kitten-medium.jpg' if the viewport is 465px or larger.
- Otherwise fallback to 'kitten-small.png' if none of the conditions are met or if the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element.

## 17. Using sizes with srcset
### Day 17: May 27, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![9-2](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-9.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-9.png)

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 9: Full Responsiveness* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

This lesson covered the combination of `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

- **srcset** - tells the browser which images and their widths it has available to choose from.
- **sizes** - tells the browser what the display size will be on the page given the size of the viewport

Here's an example:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 1500w"
  sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw,
         50vw"
  alt="Wallaby">
```

This says we have three images sized at 500px, 1000px, & 1500px, respectively, and that the display size will be 100% the viewport width for viewport widths under 250px and will be 50% the viewport width for viewport widths over 250px.

The following items were covered

- Use of `srcset` with `sizes` attribute
- Necessity to still set image size through proper media queries
- How Chrome determines what the optimal sized image resource is to download

## 11. Grunt Automation for Responsive Images
### Day 11: May 21, 2018 - Monday

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 7: Units, Formats, Environments* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

The course material was great at exposing me to new concepts of how to responsively serve images based on viewport size or device pixel density.

But it only scratched the surface on how to fully implement these responsive image techniques. I devoted some time to additional online resources to accomplish the following:

1. Understand how to fully implement **responsive image technologies**.
2. Implement **resolution switching** with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes of `<img>` tag.
    - **Resolution switching** serves the same image at a different size or resolution based on screen pixel density and/or viewport constraints.
3. Understand **art direction** through use of `<picture>` & `<source>` elements.
    - **Art direction** involves serving a different image based on space allocation.
4. Develop a sensible breakpoint system and use it to come up with ideal compression & dimension settings for image processing.
5. Implement Grunt (a task runner) to automate the process of creating multi-sized images.
6. Configure Grunt to update the HTML based on the set of images generated for each `<img>` element.

Those links are in my notes but I've included them below as well
