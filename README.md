## Jekyll Build Environment

### Day 13: July 20, 2017 - Thursday

**~~Today's~~ Last Week's Project(s):**

- Created Jekyll Build Environment on Ubuntu 16.04. This is for testing locally before committing changes to GitHub Pages.

**Progress:**

- Completed the following
  1. Spun up a Linux VM
  1. Installed, configured & updated Ubuntu
  1. Installed Nodejs, NPM, Git, Ruby, RubyGems, Bundle, Jekyll, Visual Studio Code & Chrome
  1. Cloned my Personal Page repo from GitHub
  1. Started Jekyll server - `bundle exec jekyll serve` - this watches for changes to code or content and rebuilds the site when it detects any. It also runs a lightweight http server to view changes on the fly. Pretty cool!
  1. Started local development & testing

**Link to work:**

- [README.md](https://github.com/james-priest/james-priest.github.io/blob/master/README.md "Link to GitHub README.md") from my Personal Page. This is the raw source that the template engine uses to build the site.
- [Generated Site](http://james-priest.github.io "Link to my GitHub Personal Page") This is the Jekyll static site that's generated on GitHub whenever I update, commit and push my REAME.md.

**Thoughts:**

- This was a good exercise in building a complete end-to-end dev solution.
- I started with `jekyll-theme-leap-day`, one of GitHub's officially supported templates and made modifications to the html, css, & javascript.
- This also gave me a good opportunity to practice Bash shell scripting, npm package management and VS Code plug-in configuration

---

## Finished jQuery on FCC

### Day 12: July 12, 2017 - Wednesday

**Today's Project(s):**

- Free Code Camp exercises - jQuery manipulation of DOM

**Progress:**

- Steady... I finished the jQuery section today

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:**

- I've now finished up the following FCC sections:
  - HTML5 and CSS
  - Responsive Design with Bootstrap
  - jQuery
- Next are the two Front End Development Projects to test the skills learned. These are:
  - Build a Tribute Page
  - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

---

## Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04, Jekyll, & GitHub Pages

### Day 11: July 9, 2017 - Sunday

**~~Today's~~ This Week's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges
- Created GitHub personal page
  - Cloned repo
  - Followed this process: _work locally, push changes, review & repeat..._
  - Decided to get the Jekyll static site generator runnung locally so I don't have to push changes live in order to view/test them
  - Docs said to enable Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10... I'm running a highly customized Windows 8.1. üò£
- Upgraded VMware Workstation to version 12.5.7
- Upgraded virtual instance of Ubuntu 9.10 to 14.04
  - this upgrade choked miserably and required lots of manual fixes
  - had to fix bootloader
  - reset passwords
  - reinstall display drivers, etc...
- Installed FRESH copy of Ubuntu 16.04 in a VM - all went well üòÖ
- Installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 Pro Creators update in a VM - so far so good üòä
- Sync'd bookmarks across browsers (Chrome, FF, Edge, Safari) and platforms (Win, Linux, Mac) with [Xmarks](http://xmarks.com)
  - This plugin is awesome. It works with the synchronization that Google, Microsoft & Firefox do within their browsers but you have to turn off bookmark sync for theses and let Xmarks do the Bookmark sync. I run many VMs so this works great to keep everything in check.
- Windows 7 VM
  - Streamlined OS - removed hibernation and paging. Returned them after defragmentation of virtual disk
  - Uninstalled unnecessary applications, removed duplicate data and removed old snapshots for smaller disk footprint
  - Reduced vmdk (virtual disk) size to reclaim space
- Ubuntu 16.04 VM
  - Installed & updated all default packages
  - installed vmware tools for host/guest OS integration
  - apt-got git, ruby, rubygems, jekyll and nodejs üòâ
  - now I'm ready to clone my GitHub portfolio page and go to town
- Windows 10 VM
  - Researched, installed, & configured OS features. Now I'm testing, modifying and evaluating.
  - Holding off on upgrading host OS until I can make sure all 8.1 customizations will transfer/upgrade gracefully.
  - Enabled _Developer mode_ in VM hosted instance of Win 10
  - Installed `Windows Subsystem for Linux` which is basically an Ubuntu-based Bash shell for Windows. Yay! üëèüòç

**Progress:**

- Continued jQuery DOM manipulation exercises of FCC
- Started online portfolio / resume / profile on GitHub

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- My Online Resume and personal page: [https://james-priest.github.io/](https://james-priest.github.io/)

**Thoughts:**

- Getting my personal GitHub page going was way more involved than I thought it would be. To be fair, it's very straight forward to choose a theme and set up a personal page on GitHub. Customizing requires a bit more. Here are the steps I took:
   1. Created a repo for my personal account profile page and named it `james-priest.github.io`.
   1. Went into Settings for that repo and turned on GitHub Pages and chose a theme.
   1. Modified the README.md
- So far so good! This would have been it if I didn't need a higher level of customization. Fortunately, GitHub provides [very clear docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/ "Using Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub Pages") on how to modify the CSS (scss), HTML, and create a local dev environment with Jekyll - a Ruby-based static site generator. This allows you to modify and preview without a commit to GitHub for each change. So here are the remaining steps:
  1. Upgrade my OS to Win10 to use the integrated bash shell
  1. Install ruby, gems, git & jekyll
  1. Clone repo & then it's: modify (VS Code), build (Jekyll), test (local) & deploy (git) 
- I'll finish those this week.

## GitHub Page for this log

### Day 10: July 4, 2017 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s):**

- Created GitHub Page for this repo and code log
- Watched [Intro to ASP.NET Core 1.1](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-asp-net-core-1-0-16841) on Microsoft Virtual Academy

**Progress:**

- Completed the setup of a GitHub Page for this log
- Got about halfway through Intro ASP.NET Core training

**Link to work:**

- [100 Days of Code Log GitHub Page](https://james-priest.github.io/100-days-of-code-log/)  (this page)

**Thoughts:**

Created the GitHub Page through GitHub. It uses Jekyll and one of the pre-built templates. It also add a yaml file. I may look into how to modify the template in order to correct for limited number of links on the sidebar as well as modification of the top nav bar

The Intro to ASP.NET Core class is great. It's hosted by Scott Hanselman and Maria Naggaga. I love both of them. I can't wait to finish the FCC Front End Development cert so I can switch to .NET Core Back End with C#.

## JavaScript Array Methods

### Day 9: July 2, 2017 - Sunday

**Today's Project(s):**

- javascript-array-methods - Vanilla JavaScript project to show what each JS Array object method does
- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Completed migration of javascript-array-methods v1.0.0 to GitHub
- Started jQuery selector section of FCC

**Link to work:**

[![https://gyazo.com/0a5f8557493931c87ebf87e9cabcfb85](https://i.gyazo.com/0a5f8557493931c87ebf87e9cabcfb85.png)](http://javascript-array-methods.netlify.com/)

- [JavaScript Array Methods](https://github.com/james-priest/javascript-array-methods "GitHub repo") on  GitHub - click image to see demo
- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** Finally good to get the JavaScript Array Methods app up on GitHub. Next I need to modify it to use Bootstrap and Objects to hold data rather than arrays.

---

## Code & Dev activities

### Day 8: June 30, 2017 - Friday

**~~Today's~~ Last Week's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges
- Received and accepted an invitation to join [**DWYL**](https://github.com/dwyl "Do What You Love") on GitHub
- Added projects and people to my [Stars](https://github.com/james-priest?tab=stars) & [Following](https://github.com/james-priest?tab=following) tabs on GitHub
- Signed up for [Netlify](http://netlify.com) - they host static sites through CLI deploy. npm install and deploy any repo
- Researched Back End learning path and decided on .NET Core since its going to be the highüí≤dollarüí≤ technology for 2018. Read the ASP.NET Core [prediction](https://stackify.com/net-core-csharp-next-programming-language/ "Why .NET Core and C# are the Next Big Thing") about how it will be the next big thing. I also know & love the MS development environment.
- Retooled my dev environments:
  - Updated Visual Studio 2017 to Enterprise and v15.2
  - Got my VS Code plugins in line
  - Installed [notepad2](https://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod/) (great notepad replacement)
- Evaluated many of the Code Playgrounds out there to solve for two needs:
  - having a place to test code as I go through tutorials
  - having a place to organize and  host samples of work
- Decided to set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/james-priest/code-exercises "code-exercises") to contain my source code instead. I'll still use JSBin for quick JS, ES6 and TypeScript tests.
- Created additional repos to migrate my test projects to:
  - [code-exercises](https://github.com/james-priest/code-exercises)
  - [javascript-array-methods](https://github.com/james-priest/javascript-array-methods)
  - [web-calculator](https://github.com/james-priest/web-calculator)
- Researched [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/), [FirstTimersOnly](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) movement and [How to Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/ "") in Open Source
- Got caught in a rabbit hole of learning regarding JavaScript concepts, HTML5 api features & Google Web articles. Covered the following:
  - [Functional Composition](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0 "Master the JavaScript Interview: What is Functional Composition?")
  - [Closures](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36 "Master the JavaScript Interview: What is a Closure?")
  - [Hoisting](https://dev.to/imwiss/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript "Understanding Hoisting in JavaScript")
  - [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers "Service Workers: An Introduction") or Web Workers
  - [Promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)
  - App Cache, Local Storage, Sessions Storage, IndexedDB & Web SQL
  - [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
  - Researched Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html "Introduction to Material Design")
  - Read through Google Codelabs - [Your First PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/ "You First Progressive Web App") and [Your First Offline Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/offline/)
  - Read about [CSS Grid vs. Flexbox](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/03/css-grid-vs-flexbox "CSS Grid vs. Flexbox: A Practical Comparison")

**Progress:**

- Completed Responsive Design with Bootstrap section of FCC! üòÉ

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** All this research and learning was great and necessary but it ate up another week's worth of "code" time. I'm not worried about it though.  I've come to the conclusion that it all moves me towards the same ends.

I also don't trip on whether I'm doing a tutorial or coding something from scratch. It's all development time and one usually proceeds the other if I'm going to employ the most effective learning style.

The one challenge I need to get in check is following through to the end of one project, learning path, or class with a single mindedness of purpose before getting distracted or caught up in another. I feel I might be missing something if I don't investigate and dig deep into a concept I don't fully understand. This is the thinking that gets me spread out with 10 browser instances of 20 open tabs each and then scrambling to keep it all straight. [OneTab Chrome extension](https://www.one-tab.com/ "Reduces tab clutter and memory footprint by 95%") is **great** for this.

Bottom line is I'm making progress and learning how to organize and keep 10 plates spinning at any given time. The next soft skill to incorporate will be the concept of _balance_!

## Bootstrap Responsive Design

### Day 7: June 24, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Started Responsive Design with Bootstrap section of FCC

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** It's easy for me to get distracted with any one of the six different projects I'm working on at the same time.  I need to limit my WIP in order to make consistent headway.

---

## Hoisting, Closures, and Module Patterns

### Day 6: June 22, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges
- Learned about closures & module patterns in JavaScript

**Progress:**

- Finished the Gear Up for Success section of FCC (Joined FCC forum, Linked-In Alumni Network & Free Code Camp Group in Pasadena)

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- [Understanding Hoisting in JavaScript](https://dev.to/imwiss/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript)
- [What is a Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
- [JavaScript Module System Showdown: CommonJS vs AMD vs ES2015](https://t.co/l3SLLnxvZf "JavaScript article on auth0.com")

**Thoughts:** I'm taking time to read about technologies, methodologies and language conventions. Right now it's a jumble of information but I know eventually it will all start to click and make sense.

---

## HTML & CSS in FreeCodeCamp

### Day 5: June 20, 2017 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Finished the HTML5 & CSS section

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** So I skipped 5 days of postings & tweets but still was productive in my studies. I spend 8-10 hours in front of the computer daily; sometimes its directly related to learning and code challenges but half the time it's about reading about a new technology or configuring my dev environment or fine-tuning a process. It's constant learning and applying that knowledge.

The key is to get and find efficiencies in your daily process and turn those into routine...

---

## HTML5 Exercises

### Day 4: June 15, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s):**

**Progress:**

- Completed some form element exercises
- Completed css class & id selectors

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** Today was a little light on the workload. It's funny how I can spend ALL day on the computer do code-related activities without actually coding. :/ Go figure...

The important thing is that I did get something done and posted. I'm keeping it pushin...

---

## My Personal Kanban

### Day 3: June 14, 2017 - Wednesday
